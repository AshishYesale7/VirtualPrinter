### **Description**  
The **Virtual Printer App** is an Android application that emulates a network printer. It allows developers and testers to simulate printing operations without needing physical printer hardware. 

This app aims to facilitate testing and debugging print-related functionalities in Android applications, especially when real printers are inaccessible or impractical to use.

#### **Key Features:**  
- Acts as a virtual IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) printer on Android devices.  
- Supports configuration of printer attributes and capabilities.  
- Responds to print jobs and emulates success or failure scenarios.  
- Compatible with Android's built-in print services, allowing for easy integration and testing.  
- Supports customization of the virtual printer via configuration files.  
- End-to-end testing support for different print settings and print job responses.  
- Works on various Android form factors, including phones, foldables, and tablets.  

#### **Use Cases:**  
- Testing Android applications that interact with printers.  
- Validating print services on Android without needing physical printers.  
- Automating print testing in CI environments.  

#### **Technology Stack:**  
- **Kotlin & Jetpack Compose** for the Android front-end.  
- **IPPEvePrinter** as the backend IPP implementation.  
- **NSD (Network Service Discovery)** for broadcasting the printer over the network.  
- **jIPP** (optional) for IPP handling in pure Kotlin.  
- **NDK** (if using native code for IPP).
